<p>We show interactive t-SNE plots in <a href="#fig-manifold-embedding-loadings" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. Each point is a PanUKB phenotype, colored according to the clusters identified by LLM models from the trait descriptions. The opaciy of each point is proportional to the estimated heritability of the trait.</p>
